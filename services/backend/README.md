# Backend Server
This is a FastAPI backend for a simple user management and authentication service based on Auth0.

## Endpoints
- POST /token : exchange username and password with access token (JWT) from Auth0 service
- GET /token/callback : callback from social login flow.
- GET /user/me : exchange access token with user info
- POST /user : create user in Auth0 database connection
- DELETE /user/{user_id} : remove user from Auth0 database connection
* When using google account login for the first time a user entity will be created in Auth0 with corresponding user id. This user can be deleted (from Auth0) using the user_id and the DELETE /user endpoint. the social login occurs directly between the client side and the Auth0 service w/o going through the backend.
